As you may know (or not), the exponential function can be written as the sum of a power series:

ex= ∞∑n=0 x^n/n! = 1 + x + x/22! + x/33! + ...

So does many other functions, such as trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.

These power series are extremely handy when it comes to fast approximations of all those functions. 
Butthey can also be used to exponentiate (for instance) mathematical objects (as long as they can be elevatedto integer powers).
One could for example compute the cosine of a function, the exponentiation of a graph,the hyperbolic tangent of a rotation or
the sine of a square matrix (which is what you will do here)...

Given a matrix and the name of a function, your program must apply the latter to the former, and print theresult.
